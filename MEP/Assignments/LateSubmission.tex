\textbf{Late Submission}\\
Failure to submit your assignment on or before the date and time indicated on Moodle will result in a penalty of 5\% per day or part thereof.
\\
\\
Late submission penalties will not apply in cases where a valid medical certificate is provided.  In such instances an extension of time will be granted for the duration of illness stated on the medical certificate that falls after the submission date.  A copy of the medical certificate must be included with the late submission.
\\
\\
Late submission penalties may also be avoided in exceptional circumstances.  These will be dealt with on a case by case basis.  Please note that loss of pen-drives, inability to use or access the software etc. will not be considered 'exceptional circumstances'.
